# OpenCV Video Processing

This project uses OpenCV to perform video processing tasks such as frame extraction, grayscale conversion, and adding text overlays.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your machine. You can install OpenCV using pip:
pip install opencv-python

## Usage

The main function `execute_part2` accepts an input video file path as an argument and generates an output video file with modified frames.

```python
input_file_path = 'input3.mp4'  # Enter the input video file path here
execute_part2(input_file_path)
The output video file will be saved as part2_output.mp4 in the same directory.
